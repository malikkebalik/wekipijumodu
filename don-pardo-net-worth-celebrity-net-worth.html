During that entire time, he only missed one full season from 1981 until 1982 when the show was announced by Mel Brandt or Bill Hanrahan.</p><p>In addition to his work on "Saturday Night Live!," Pardo continued working on other side projects, including various musical projects.

The single became an international hit.</p><p>Even after Padro retired from NBC in 2004, he continued to announce for "Saturday Night Live" at the request of the show's executive producer, <a href=#>Lorne Michaels</a>. In 2006, he started prerecording the announcement from a studio at his home in Arizona, though that arrangement did not last long as the producers decided he should be in studio. He then began flying to New York every week. He appeared during the closing segment of the show on February 23, 2008 to blow out the candles on a cake celebrating his 90th birthday. Beginning with the 36th season in 2010, Pardo again began recording his announcements from his home.</p><p>In 2010, Pardo was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.
