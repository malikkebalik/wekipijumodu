Mitch Hedberg was known for his surreal, absurdist humor and deadpan delivery style. His comedy and onstage persona garnered him a cult following, with members of the audience often shouting out the punchlines to his jokes before he got to them. Hedberg made a number of appearances on television, and wrote, directed, and starred in the 1999 independent film "Los Enchiladas!"</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Mitch Hedberg was born on February 24, 1968 in St. Paul, Minnesota to Mary and Arne. He was of Finnish-Swedish, German, and Czech descent. As a teenager, he attended Harding High School, but took little interest in his education.</p><h2 id=stand-up-comedy><strong>Stand-up Comedy</strong></h2><p>Hedberg launched his stand-up comedy career in Florida. Eventually, he moved to Seattle, Washington and started touring. In 1996, Hedberg had his big break when he performed on the "Late Show with <a href=# title="David Letterman Net Worth">David Letterman</a>"; he would go on to make several more appearances on the show over the years. In 1997, Hedberg won the grand prize at the Seattle Comedy Competition. Over the final two years of the decade, he performed on "Premium Blend," "Comedy Central Presents," and "The Late Late Show with <a href=# title="Craig Kilborn Net Worth">Craig Kilborn</a>," and released the live comedy album "Strategic Grill Locations," which was recorded at the Laff Stop comedy club in Houston, Texas. Hedberg released his second comedy album, "Mitch All Together," in 2003; it was recorded at the Acme Comedy Club in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A third comedy album, "Do You Believe in Gosh?," was released posthumously in 2008, having been recorded two months prior to Hedberg's death in 2005.</p><p>In his stand-up, Hedberg was known for his surreal, absurdist humor, non sequiturs, wordplay, and deadpan delivery. His jokes were typically short and often in the form of pithy one-liners. Sometimes, he added disclaimers to the end of a joke if it was poorly received, such as "that joke's dumb, I'm aware of that." During recordings for his comedy albums, Hedberg would often state that he would find a way to edit a failed joke in postproduction to make it seem like it was better received by the audience. Over the years, his comedy and unique onstage persona garnered him a cult following, with audience members sometimes shouting out the punchlines to his jokes before he could get to them himself.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-327592 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hedberg.jpg alt width=796 height=523 sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-327592 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=film-career><strong>Film Career</strong></h2><p>Beyond his stand-up career, Hedberg wrote, directed, and starred in the independent film "Los Enchiladas!," which premiered at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.
