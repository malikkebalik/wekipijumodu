Jordan wondered if Jason had any thoughts on Cyrus Renault’s (Jeff Kober) missing mother.</p><p>Jason stayed mum, and Jordan pointed out that if Florence Grey (Annie Abbott) was moved across state lines it would become a federal issue. Jason would only tell Jordan that things were “handled.”</p><p>As Jason and Jordan were talking, a small package was delivered to Jordan, and Jordan said that this involved Jason.</p><p>In the jail area, Portia Robinson (Brooke Kerr) came to see Marcus Taggert (Asante Jones). Portia was upset over Taggert’s faked death, and she thought that Taggert should work with her to clear his name and expose Cyrus for who he is. Taggert insisted that he was guilty and needed to face the charged against him.</p><p>Soon, Jordan came in and Portia left. Jordan told Taggert about Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) being missing and presumed dead. Taggert was upset, and they mused about Taggert and Sonny’s complicated history, noting that Sonny was a complicated man.</p><p>At the hospital, Cyrus and Laura Collins (Genie Francis) bickered about the bombing at The Floating Rib and about Florence’s kidnapping. Cyrus got peeved and grabbed Laura’s arm, and just then Leslie Webber (Denise Alexander) materialized and told Cyrus to unhand Laura.</p><p>Leslie met Cyrus, and she quickly learned who Cyrus was and what his relation was to Laura. Cyrus called Leslie the tramp who slept with his married father.</p><p>Leslie lashed out about the bombing and Lulu Spencer’s (Emme Rylan) injuries, and Cyrus strongly implied that Leslie set all of this in motion.</p><p>After a lot of unsavory back and forth between Leslie and Cyrus, Laura had had enough, especially when Cyrus tried to pin how he’d turned out onto Leslie. Laura sent Leslie off to an exam room, and Laura blasted Cyrus for using her mother as a scapegoat for his lifetime of horrible decisions.</p><p>Cyrus insisted that Laura needed to resolve the situation with Jason immediately, and he mused that something could happen to Leslie. “Spoken like an innocent man,” Laura fumed. Cyrus shrugged innocently and walked off. Laura found her mother crying in the exam room and comforted her.</p><p>At the Quartermaine mansion, Michael Corinthos (Chad Duell) got off the phone with the authorities, having learned that the search for Sonny was now a search and recovery mission, meaning that the authorities presumed Sonny to be dead.</p><p>Willow Corinthos (Katelyn MacMullen) walked into the room, all dressed up for her dinner with Harrison Chase (Josh Swickard). Willow offered to stay, but Michael thought that Willow should go try to figure things out with Chase. Michael said that there was nothing anyone could do about Sonny right now.</p><p>At the Metro Court, Dante Falconeri (Dominick Zamprogna) caught up with Chase at the bar. The ex-partners talked briefly, and Dante said he was sticking around Port Charles to be with family and tie up loose ends.</p><p>At a table, Peter August (Wes Ramsey) tried to call the prison to talk with Dr. Arthur Cabot (Time Winters), but the authorities said that Dr. Cabot was in solitary confinement and couldn’t accept visitors. Peter then literally bumped into Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) and snipped at her in frustration.</p><p>Dante watched from the bar intently as Peter told Sam to stay out of his way and walked out of the restaurant. Sam saw Dante watching her and Peter. Across the room, Willow walked in and met Chase.</p><p>Both Willow and Chase were nervous, and they made small talk until Willow addressed the elephant in the room.</p><p>Willow said that the deception really hurt her, and Chase said that he missed Willow intensely. Willow said that she missed Chase, too, but that the pain she felt was still real even if the betrayal wasn’t. Chase grabbed Willow’s hand and said that he never stopped loving her, and Chase and Willow kissed.</p><p>Back at the bar, Sam joined Dante and noted that he had been watching Peter. Sam thought that they might have aligned interests, and that if Dante found anything on Peter, he should pass it her way. Next, Dante and Sam reminisced about Sonny and discussed Julian Jerome’s (William deVry) death.</p><p>At the Corinthos house, Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) imagined Sonny coming home, then woke up as the doorbell rang. It was Sasha Gilmore (Sofia Mattsson), who wanted to thank Carly for trying to help her before she overdosed.</p><p>Sasha shared that she’s been going to outpatient therapy, and that she’d always be in debt to Carly.</p><p>Soon, Michael arrived to give Carly the news that Sonny’s rescue effort was now a recovery effort. Sasha learned about Sonny’s accident, and she decided to stay and comfort Michael. Sasha and Michael decided to take a walk together on the grounds.</p><p>Meanwhile, Carly cried in the kitchen, telling herself to stop it because Sonny was coming back.</p><p>Later, Jason arrived looking glum and with an update for Carly. The divers in New Jersey had found Sonny’s St. Christopher’s necklace, and Jason said that they thought that Sonny had been pinned under the bridge wreckage when it collapsed. The authorities thought that Sonny’s body then got carried down the river.</p><p>Carly started panicking and hyperventilating, saying that she and Sonny couldn’t stand each other in the beginning and that she didn’t know what made her fall in love with him. Carly sobbed as Jason held and comforted her.</p><p>Back at the hospital, Peter entered and asked a nurse about how he might contact a former hospital employee – Dr. Andre Maddox (Anthony Washington). And near the elevators, Cyrus ambled up to Portia to discuss Taggert’s resurrection. Portia walked off, saying, “We’re done here,” as Cyrus looked amused.</p><p>Finally, somewhere outside in the snow and ice, Sonny was sprawled on the ground unconscious.</p><p>That was a terrific episode of General Hospital, and it was a great way to round out the week!
