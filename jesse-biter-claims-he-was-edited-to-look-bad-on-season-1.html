In fact, they complained about Ferrier and suggested another stew be their “go-to” during the remainder of their extended charter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jesse-biter-played-the-villian-role-on-below-deck-mediterranean-season-1>Jesse Biter played the ‘villian’ role on ‘Below Deck Mediterranean’ Season 1?</h2><p id=par-2_69>Biter said he knew that producers painted him in a poor light in order to create drama. “People who know me know this isn’t real,” he told <a href=#>The Sarasota Observer</a>. “Bad service equals complaints equals drama equals good ratings. My mom’s best friend loves the show, and she had a big laugh watching it. The producers wouldn’t be doing their job if everyone on the show were happy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Below-Deck-Med-16.jpg><p id=par-3_125>He insisted that despite his portrayal on the show, he and his friends had a great time. “We had a lot of fun,” he said. “It was a great experience. We learned a lot about how a reality TV show is made, which was a lot of fun. A lot of people don’t get it, but it was really a game. And it was fun playing a role.” And while some guests have returned to the series, Biter and friends have yet to return for another voyage. But he said he’d definitely do it again if given the chance. “We would definitely do it again. We might want to have more say in how the story is told, but we would absolutely do it again.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hannah-ferrier-and-jesse-biter-take-their-feud-to-twitter>Hannah Ferrier and Jesse Biter take their feud to Twitter</h2><p id=par-4_58>Biter shocked Ferrier when he told Captain Mark Howard that he did not want <a href=#>Ferrier on service</a>. She said during the season that she had never had someone say that about her in her five-year yachting career. Howard seemed to understand that the ownership was on the guests and it was not because Ferrier’s service was flawed.</p><p id=par-5_27>Howard <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>tweeted</a> during the episode about the situation too. “Hannah Ferrier is a fantastic Chief Stew,” he wrote. “This is the request by the charter guests.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_29>Biter responded to the remark with, “I don’t think she likes Americans.” Ferrier shot back, “I like Americans.
