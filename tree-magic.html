We will discuss 4 species of trees and their correspondences. We also have more tree articles in our series on Celtic Tree Months.</p><h2><strong>Our Connection To Trees</strong></h2><p>Today pagans continue to have an intimate relationship with trees in order to make connections with the natural and spiritual world.</p><p>Meditation and grounding work are both important aspects of <a href=#>pagan rituals</a>. Trees are more than willing to help us!</p><p>Choose a tree that you can comfortably sit underneath.</p><p>Start by wrapping your arms around the tree. Place your check against the trunk. Breathe in. Breathe out.</p><p>You can meditate on whatever pleases you. Perhaps you have a problem. Sit under a tree with your back firmly against the trunk. Envision your problem leaving your body, traveling up the trunk, and being expelled by the leaves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/7b32e5e4-506c-4c0b-86c8-1ba024f4a2a8/Untitled+design+%2868%29.png><h2><strong>Trees and Their Magic</strong></h2><p>There are so many species of trees that complement our magic.</p><p>The trees that are part of the Celtic Ogham months each have their own longer article.</p><p><strong>Read our article </strong><a href=#><strong>13 Celtic Tree Months</strong> </a><strong>to learn more about those trees including the oak, holly, ash, and hawthorn.</strong></p><h2><strong>Cedar Tree</strong></h2><p>The eastern and western cedar tree is a very common tree across North America. It is often considered a shrub or trash tree although we know it is far superior.</p><p>The cedar tree not only produces sweet-smelling wood it is very beneficial in magical preparations. Cedar is a popular smudging plant for cleansing and repelling negative spirits. In addition, it helps women recover after childbirth.</p><p>Egyptians used it during the <a href=#>mummification process</a> and the Celts often placed cedar sprigs on the heads of their fallen enemies. The Cherokee believe that their ancestors reside in the Cedar tree.</p><h2><strong>Cedar Tree Correspondences</strong></h2><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p><strong>Masculine Energy</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Symbolic Meaning</strong>: <a href=#>Nordic Grandmother Cedar</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ruling Planet</strong>: Jupiter, Sun</p></li><li><p><strong>Ruling Element</strong>: Fire</p></li><li><p><strong>Season</strong>: Winter and <a href=#>Imbolc</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Corresponding Star Sign</strong>: Leo</p></li><li><p><strong>Flowers: </strong>the white blossoms are a symbol of purity</p></li><li><p><strong>Birds: </strong>Goldfinch</p></li><li><p><strong>Colors: </strong>Gold, green</p></li><li><p><strong>Gemstone</strong>: Aventurine</p></li><li><p><strong>Deities: </strong>Artemis, Mesopotamian god Enki-Ea, Persephone, and Sezh.</p></li></ul><p>Cedar was traditionally planted around cemeteries to keep the evil spirits contained. Traditional African American hoodoo uses cedar to draw someone towards a house or in spells to remove someone from a house.</p><p>Wands made of cedar are especially good at cleansing and casting a circle, protection spells, and summoning spirits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/07cd0964-4681-4e8f-8a31-5d726705f2f0/www.celebratepaganholidays.com+%284%29.png><h3><strong>Make a Cedar Smudge Stick</strong></h3><p>Locate a healthy cedar tree<strong> </strong>on your property or somewhere you have permission to harvest. Ask permission from the tree, take only what you need, and leave a small gift for the tree or wildlife.</p><li><p>Gather some branches or twigs. You will want to have about ten 5-inch pieces to bundle together.</p></li><li><p>Bring them home and lay them out to dry a bit for 24 hours.</p></li><li><p>Place them in an oval cigar-shaped bundle.</p></li><li><p>Tie a white piece of string or hemp around the leaves so that the leaves are snug.</p></li><li><p>Leave your smudge stick to dry for 10-14 days.</p></li><h2><strong>Elm</strong></h2><p>Elm trees are native to North America, Europe, and parts of Asia and are valued in many cultures. Sadly in many parts of the world, the elm tree has become endangered due to Dutch Elm disease which is spread by a beetle.</p><p>Elms are associated with Elves and the Norse Alfar. Legend says that if you sit under an elm at night and sing to the elves they will come and greet you. Try leaving them offerings of coins, mead, tobacco, and <a href=#>sage </a>as well.</p><p>The mighty elm is also associated with death. Greeks and Celts featured elms in their stories related to the underworld.</p><p>It’s the tree of Hermes. When the Sibyl of Cumae leads Aeneas down to the Underworld he is welcomed by an elm. Undertakers often saught out elm wood for coffins.</p><p>In Britain, there is a variety of elm known as the “wych elm” which was named that because witches met under it at night.</p><p>Elmwood is popular for making longbows due to its strength.</p><h2><strong>Elm Tree Correspondences</strong></h2><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p><strong>Feminine Energy</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Symbolic Meaning</strong>: The Tree of Justice, Arbitrator, protection, support, balance</p></li><li><p><strong>Ruling Planet</strong>: Mercury, <a href=#>Saturn</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Ruling Element</strong>: Water</p></li><li><p><strong>Season</strong>: Winter and <a href=#>Yule</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Corresponding Star Sign</strong>: Capricorn</p></li><li><p><strong>Flowers: </strong>the white blossoms are a symbol of purity</p></li><li><p><strong>Birds: </strong>Lapwing, Ruffled Grouse</p></li><li><p><strong>Colors: </strong>Blue, green</p></li><li><p><strong>Gemstone</strong>: Moss Agate, Turquoise</p></li><li><p><strong>Deities: </strong><a href=#>Cerridwen</a><strong>, </strong>Dionysus, Gaia, <a href=#>Hecate,</a> Loki, <a href=#>Odin</a>, Orpheus</p></li></ul><p><strong>Elm Magic</strong></p><p>Elm is known for its connection with nature spirits and is popular among Green Witches. People on the Wiccan path use elm to connect to the divine feminine.</p><p>Elm is often used in love spells especially those that involve stability. Place elm branches on your altar when doing love spells or use small pieces of bark in a charm.</p><p>Tying a small bundle of elm twigs, setting a strong positive intention, and then burning helps to protect yourself from gossip and ill acts.</p><p>Elm has a comforting aspect and is often used with older adults and those in the crone stage who are going through life changes.</p><h2><strong>Maple</strong></h2><p>Several species of maples are common throughout North America and Europe. Maple trees are valuable for wood and of course, the sugar maple provided many cultures with a sweet treat and a preservative.</p><p>While you can tap many types of maples the sugar maple has the highest concentration.</p><p>The sugar maple was a particularly important tree in Native American cultures and Maple Syrup dances were common in late winter. Many stories are told about how the sugar tree offered her sap to humans.</p><p>Check out my YouTube Channel for pagan and witchcraft videos!</p><h3><strong>How the Lenepes Got Sugar</strong></h3><p>In one story told by the Lenepes, the sugar maple known as Axsinaminshi developed this terrible itching because beetles had gotten under her bark. She asked the animals for help but none could help her until Papa’xes, the woodpecker came. He ate all the bugs but became very thirsty when he was done.</p><p>So Axsinaminshi told Pap’xes, tap into my trunk and the holes will fill with sweet sap. Drink all you want. So to this day the sugar maple and the woodpecker have a special relationship.</p><p>A wonderful children's story of the Ojibwe and gathering the sap of Ininatig, the sugar maple tree</p><p>The sugar maple is not native in Europe and so there is not as many magical relationships as there are in the US.</p><p>Wiccans feel connected to the maple because the five-pointed leaf resembles the pentacle.</p><h3><strong>Maple Correspondences</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p><strong>Feminine Energy</strong></p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p><strong>Symbolic Meaning</strong>: Abundance, prosperity, balance, self-love</p></li><li><p><strong>Ruling Planet</strong>: Jupiter, the moon</p></li><li><p><strong>Ruling Element</strong>: Water</p></li><li><p><strong>Season</strong>: Late winter and fall</p></li><li><p><strong>Corresponding Star Sign</strong>: Virgo and Libra</p></li><li><p><strong>Flowers: </strong>Peony</p></li><li><p><strong>Birds: </strong>Great-horned owl</p></li><li><p><strong>Colors: </strong>Red and Yellow</p></li><li><p><strong>Gemstone</strong>: Jade, Topaz</p></li><li><p><strong>Deities:</strong> Danu, Hera, Jupiter, Neptune</p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/9f065bd2-b547-4712-aa06-3f003b3b9872/www.celebratepaganholidays.com+%285%29.png><h2><strong>Maple Magic</strong></h2><p>Maple trees support magic about <a href=#>self-love and balance</a>.

Use them in spells when you are going to take a trip or wish to reach an astral plane.</p><p>Check out my YouTube Channel!</p><h2><strong>Pine Tree</strong></h2><p>Pine trees are widespread globally across the Northern Hemisphere. They have a range of habitats including everything from the arctic to desert ecosystems.</p><p>Like maple trees, pines are important for their economic value. Pine nuts and pine oil are valued crops and the wood is common in lumber and furniture.</p><p>Pine trees also provide valuable shelter to wildlife.</p><p>Pine tree branches and pine cones are fabulous decorations for Yule. Pine symbolizes rebirth and renewal.</p><h3><strong>Iroquis and Tree of Peace</strong></h3><p>The Haudenosaunee Nation (Iroquis) refers to the Eastern White Pine as the Tree of Peace. The story tells us how the different tribes were fighting among themselves.</p><p>Dekanawidah, a great leader, traveled to each of the tribes to encourage peace and understanding. He carried pine boughs to symbolize his intentions to bring peace to all people.</p><p>Dekanawidah had a powerful message and united the tribes into what became known as The Five Nations Confederacy (Haudenosaunee Confederacy) between the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca tribes.</p><p>The Eastern White Pine is the centerpiece of the seal of the <a href=#>Haudenosaunee Confederacy.</a></p><h3><strong>Pine Tree Correspondences</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p><strong>Masculine Energy</strong></p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p><strong>Symbolic Meaning</strong>: “Nobles of the Wood” (Irish), peace, rebirth/renewal, health, longevity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ruling Planet</strong>: Jupiter, Mars</p></li><li><p><strong>Ruling Element</strong>: Fire</p></li><li><p><strong>Season</strong>: Winter</p></li><li><p><strong>Corresponding Star Sign</strong>: Cancer, Capricorn</p></li><li><p><strong>Flowers:</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Birds: </strong>Crow, Raven</p></li><li><p><strong>Colors: </strong>Black, Green</p></li><li><p><strong>Gemstone</strong>: Emerald, Obsidian</p></li><li><p><strong>Deities:</strong> Ariadne, Artemis, Diana, Dionysus, Isis, Pan, <a href=#>Saturn</a></p></li></ul><h2><strong>Pine Tree Magic</strong></h2><p>Pine essential oil works well with candle magic</p><p>Pine cones increase longevity - put one in your pocket or purse.

They are also considered to be excellent for any non-verbal spells.</p><p>We often think of ash when making a besom but pine works well also. Pine besoms work especially well for ridding your space of negative spirits</p><p>A homemade wreath of pine boughs is a great way to protect your home in winter. Below is one I made.</p><p>I started with a <a href=#>wire wreath frame </a>and then sustainably gathered cedar and pine branches.

Older trees provide nourishment and protection to saplings. Trees communicate during droughts and insect infestations through mycorrhizal networks.</p><p>This is a fabulous, fabulous book that made me feel so much closer to trees and helped me take my tree magic to a whole new level. This book is all about how trees communicate with each other.</p><h2><strong>The Great Demise</strong></h2><p>Ironically we kill these beautiful gentle souls for our endless greed. Trees are still used for lumber, toilet paper, and pencils even though we have many alternatives available.</p><p>I find it horrific when a new subdivision is built. The trees are cut down, burned on the spot, and then roads are named after trees. In the process animal homes were destroyed, oxygen is no longer manufactured, and you have reinforced the evil ideology that nature is bad.</p><p>When I was a <a href=#>wildlife rehabilitator </a>I would go into building areas and look around the newly cut trees in case any baby animals had fallen from them and were injured or orphaned.</p><p>Trees are basic to the survival of the planet. Both physically and spiritually.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/4b96e58c-309c-4f49-9785-681dc1caf951/CPH+harvest.png><p><strong>Author, Ame Vanorio,</strong> is a lifelong pagan, an <a href=#>environmental educator,</a> and a licensed wildlife rehabilitator.
