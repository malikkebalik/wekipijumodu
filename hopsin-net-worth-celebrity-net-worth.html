Known for using the internet to draw a fan base, he has released five studio albums and has collaborated with other artists including <a href=# title="Tech N9ne Net Worth">Tech N9ne</a>, <a href=# title="B.o.B Net Worth">B.o.B</a>, <a href=# title="Travis Barker Net Worth">Travis Barker</a>, <a href=# title="Paul Wall Net Worth">Paul Wall</a>, <a href=# title="Insane Clown Posse Net Worth">Insane Clown Posse</a>, Brotha Hung Lynch, <a href=# title="Kid Cudi Net Worth">Kid Cudi</a>, B-Real, <a href=# title="Xzibit Net Worth">Xzibit</a>, Futuristic, and more. He has become known for his look featuring white contacts. He has had minor success with the singles "Sag My Pants", "Ill Mind of Hopsin 5", "Hop Is Back", "Ill Mind of Hopsin 7", "Crown Me", "Fly", and "Ill Mind of Hopsin 8".</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Marcus Hopson was born in Los Angeles, California on July 18, 1985 and was raised in the largely Hispanic neighborhood of Panorama City, Los Angeles. He attended James Monroe High School where he placed some special education classes. Hopsin became an avid skateboarder at age 12 and many of his music videos today feature him skateboarding. He began rapping at age 16. In 2004, he and a group of friends were arrested for vandalizing school property. What started out as a school prank led to them being held on $20,000 bail. Hopsin had dropped out of high school by that point and he was sent to Los Angeles County Jail where he spent a year.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Hopson credits <a href=# title="Eminem Net Worth">Eminem</a> as the rapper who initially got him interested in hip-hop music. Upon his release from jail in 2005, he began to pursue a career in music. He purchased a microphone and installed FL Studio on his computer. Ruthless Records signed him almost immediately. Hopson's lead single from his debut album was released on May 27, 20098. Unfortunately, the relationship between label and artist was never successful, and he claims that he was not supported during production of his first album, "Gazing at the Moonlight", and that he was not able to hear any of the masters before it was released. "Gazing at the Moonlight" was finally released in October 2009 but to little promotion. He and Ruthless parted ways in 2009, and a year later, he founded his own record company Funk Volume, with Damien Ritter. Swizz, Ritter's younger brother and a former classmate of Hopsin, was the first artist to be signed to Funk Volume. Shortly after launching Funk Volume, both Hopsin and SwizZz released a collaborative mixtape titled "Haywire" in June 2009 to promote the label.</p><p>Up next Hopsin released his first single, "Nocturnal Rainbows,"&nbsp; off his upcoming second album. In October 2010, Hopsin released a music video on YouTube for the song "Sag My Pants," the second single off the next album. The music video became a YouTube success and holds over 54 million views as of 2021. His second album, "Raw", was released in the fall of 2010. In the spring of 2011, Hopsin went on a nationwide two-month tour to promote "Raw" with the I Am Raw tour.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-342526 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hopsin.jpg alt="Hopsin Net Worth" width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-342526 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Vincent Sandoval/WireImage)</p><p>Hopsin released the fourth video in his series of "Ill Mind of Hopsin" videos.
