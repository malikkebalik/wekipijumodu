Best known as the eldest son of <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>, Prince Michael Jackson is not to be confused with Prince Michael Jackson II, his younger half-brother (who is also known as "Blanket"). Over the years, Prince has appeared in a range of TV shows as both an actor and a television personality. Although Prince has apparently made an effort to "make his own way" in life, his identity remains in the shadow of his father, the legendary "King of Pop." It is unlikely that he will ever emerge from this shadow and all of the controversy associated with Michael Jackson's life.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. was born on February 13th of 1997 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. His mother is <a href=#>Debbie Rowe</a>, a dermatology assistant who married Michael Jackson in 1996. Prior to the marriage, Rowe had expressed a desire to bear Jackson's children when she learned of his failed marriage with <a href=#>Lisa Marie Presley</a>. Allegedly, she had expressed these desires even while Jackson and Presley were married.</p><p>Rowe has stated that she was artificially inseminated, although she initially refused to reveal any details of her son's conception. This has sparked many rumors, and there are some who claim that Prince is not his father's biological son. Some state that his real father is actor <a href=# title="Mark Lester Net Worth">Mark Lester</a>, while others claim it is dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. With all that said, Prince has stated that no matter what, he sees himself as his father's son because he was raised by him alongside his siblings.</p><p>After Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. was married, he was quickly nicknamed Prince. His father quickly took sole custody and assumed full parental responsibilities. By 1999, he and Rowe had divorced, with Jackson taking full custody rights. Although Prince's mother reportedly received an $8 million settlement and a house in Beverly Hills, she had signed a "rock-solid" prenuptial agreement, and therefore had no access to Jackson's real wealth.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-168912 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Prince-Michael-Jackson.jpg alt="Prince Michael Jackson" width=510 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-168912 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</p><p>Whisked away to the Neverland Ranch, Prince rarely saw his mother as a young boy. He was raised primarily by a "team" of six nannies and caretakers. By 2004, Michael Jackson has been charged with 10 counts of child abuse. Debbie Rowe became concerned and sought to play a more central role in Prince's life – although she had previously terminated her legal parental rights in 2001. Nevertheless, she sought to have the decision reversed and eventually won additional access to her children. However, Prince allegedly refused to call her "mother."</p><p>When Michael Jackson passed away in 2009, his mother <a href=#>Katherine</a> was granted guardianship of Prince and his siblings <a href=#>Paris Jackson</a> and <a href=#>Blanket Jackson</a>. In the years since, he has allegedly been involved in many disputes over his father's estate with the rest of his family. His godparents are actors <a href=# title="Macaulay Culkin Net Worth">Macaulay Culkin</a> and <a href=# title="Elizabeth Taylor Net Worth">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, both of whom were friends with Michael Jackson.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>For the most part, Prince lives a very private life and rarely appears on television. Perhaps one of his most notable appearances came during his father's funeral when he sang on stage with his family. However, he declined to give a speech unlike many of his family members.</p><p>In 2003, he appeared in the documentary "Living with Michael Jackson." In 2009, he appeared in a live telecast of his father's memorial service. One year later, he was spotted at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. Also in 2010, he appeared on "The <a href=# title="Oprah Winfrey Net Worth">Oprah Winfrey</a> Show," speaking with Oprah about his experiences over the years alongside his siblings and his grandmother, Katherine. In 2011, he made another brief appearance on "The X Factor." In 2013, he appeared once again on "Entertainment Tonight." That year, he also appeared in his first acting role – playing the role of Cooper in an episode of "Beverly Hills 90210." Although this was his first acting role, it's not clear whether he will ever act again.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-315949 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Prince-Michael-Jackson-1.jpg alt="Prince Michael Jackson" width=900 height=644 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-315949 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by James Coldrey/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=inheritance><strong>Inheritance</strong></h2><p>Michael Jackson's will expressly left 40% of his assets to his three children, to be split evenly. Another 20% was left to various children's charities and the final 40% was left to support his mother Katherine. Upon Katherine's death, that 40% balance goes to Michael's kids, which means eventually his three children will split 80% of the estate.</p><p>At the time of his death, Michael's estate was actually in debt to the tune of $500 million. Fortunately for his heirs, in the years since his passing, the Jackson estate has generated over $700 million from royalties, licensing deals and box office proceeds related to the film "This is It."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZL2ztc2cnGalmZi1orHLZqGam5uovK95zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./rodger-bumpass-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Rodger Bumpass Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
