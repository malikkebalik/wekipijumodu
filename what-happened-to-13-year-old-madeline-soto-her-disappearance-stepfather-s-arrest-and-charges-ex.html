Please take care while reading.</strong></p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>Not long ago, the body of 11-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas girl Audrii Cunningham was discovered</a>, suspected to have been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">murdered by a family friend and neighbor</a>. More recently but not far apart, the body of 13-year-old <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madeline Soto</a></strong> from Florida was found.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>The prime suspect is also a man, but in this case, a man who had an even greater responsibility of protecting her. It feels like, especially as of late, these kinds of cases happen way too often. But it doesn’t – and it shouldn’t – make it an easier pill to swallow.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Instead of protecting her, her mother’s long-term boyfriend, Stephan Sterns, 37, arrested two days before Madeline’s body was found, appears to have done the unthinkable. One good look at his arrest affidavit is enough to make any sensible person feel sick. However, the initial arrest affidavit does not include the possibility that he was the one who also claimed his stepdaughter’s life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-overwhelming-evidence-against-sterns data-injectable=false>Overwhelming evidence against Sterns</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Design-sem-nome-2024-03-05T110415.932.png><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>Madeline disappeared on February 26, less than a week after her 13th anniversary. She was reported to have been missing since Sterns’ dropped her off near her school but an official missing child’s report wasn’t filed until that evening, after her mother went to school to pick her up at around 4:30 pm and was told her daughter hadn’t been in attendance all day.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>It was reported that Maddie – as she was known – was last seen outside a Church wearing a green sweatshirt, black shorts, and white shoes. This, as stated by police, was likely not the case. If there was a girl of this description at Church that morning, it wasn’t Madeline.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>Shockingly, as her mother pled for help and her daughter’s safe return in one of the interviews she gave, Sterns can be seen in the back, loitering around while knowing exactly what he did. He can be seen nervously fidgeting, cracking his knuckles, and, it seems to me, making his constant presence known to his girlfriend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Design-sem-nome-2024-03-05T110608.811.png><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=true>Even if Sterns is found innocent of having taken Madeline’s life, there is little way to explain away why he had an extensive collection of explicit sexual material featuring a child at their family home on his phone; or why his phone coincidentally reset to factory settings on the day she disappeared. It is also reported that he tried to get rid of other evidence, like Maddie’s school PC and backpack, by throwing them in the trash in the early morning of Feb. 26.</p><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>Sterns was first arrested on two counts: Count 1, Sexual Battery, and Count 2, Possession of Child Sexual Material – in other words, he had recorded (and deleted) instances of his abuse which the investigators were able to recover. It is usual for police <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to arrest suspects on lesser charges</a> – although ‘lesser’ in this case sounds like a brutal understatement – before bringing out the ultimate capital charge once enough evidence has been gathered.</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>During the interview wherein he surrendered his phone, Sterns made some odd, and ultimately self-incriminating statements. One was that he dropped Madeline down the street from her school, about half a mile away, instead of at the school gates like the family said was usual. That morning, Madeline had also coincidently “forgotten” her phone at home. When she was still <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">missing, her mother, Jennifer, </a>blamed her forgetfulness on her ADHD, but we now know that this time, her ADHD had nothing to do with it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>A whopping 60 new charges</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Design-sem-nome-2024-03-13T115436.517.png><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>But the most damning evidence has to be the inexcusable sexual material, assumingly of Maddie, contained in his phone. From the first <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">arrest affidavit</a>, although it is partly censored, what is readable is horrifying enough. So horrifying in fact, that you immediately understand why, allegedly, Maddie texted her friends shortly before her disappearance saying she intended to go live in the woods once she turned 13.</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>More recently, on March 12, Stephan Sterns was hit with another 60 new charges. At face value, this tells me investigators are ready to nail this guy and bring the hammer down on him with Karma’s full force, but, while the evidence for these new charges is not circumstantial but very much tangible, they are also meticulously building up a case against Sterns and, as many reckon, it won’t be long until charges related to the actual murder are brought forward.</p><p data-characters=23 data-current-count=23 data-injectable=false>The 60 new charges are:</p><li>Eight counts of Sexual Battery on a Child Under 12</li><li>Five counts of Sexual Battery with a Child 12-18</li><li>Seven counts of Lewd and Lascivious Molestation</li><li>40 counts of Unlawful Possession of Materials Depicting Sexual Performance by a Child 10 or More Images</li><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>In other words, the number of images and videos he had of his assaults on Maddie is in the hundreds and they started before she was 12. We don’t know two important things that may complicate the already-complicated case: One, whether these videos were for his depraved private use or if he went even further and distributed them; two, if he had other videos of other children he abused.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>Even without a murder charge, these new counts mean that Sterns may become eligible for the death penalty in the State of Florida if convicted. He is jailed at the Osceola County Department of Corrections with no bail.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>It is not a stretch to assume Madeline had wanted to flee to the woods due to the monster at home. Unfortunately, she wasn’t able to. All we can hope now is that anyone culpable for her long-time suffering and eventual tragic demise faces the most appropriate justice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Design-sem-nome-2024-03-05T111921.948.png><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>If you live or frequent the area and can remember anything that might help the ongoing investigation, such as having seen Sterns’ car (as shown above) you’re encouraged to call the crime line at 800-423-8477.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1osCMoZipqJWjsqV506hkamtdrrKivoyoo51lnZaxprjIp5xmq5%2BpvG60xKtknaGjlr2xscCrmKeblWKur7CMrKueqJaWwamx0axkmqqimsC1ecSxp6WZmaOypXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./35-black-nail-ideas-to-screenshot-for-your-next-mani-appointment.html>&#171;&nbsp;35 Black Nail Ideas To Screenshot For Your Next Mani Appointment</a>
