Although being the famous actor’s wife, the lady has made a great effort to keep all the information about her net worth and salary private.</p><p>This, as a matter of fact, gives fewer chances to pondering the net worth information.&nbsp; Likewise, the marriage turned her around to take care of the family, so there is not much information about her net worth.</p><p>Apart from this, the net worth of her husband is<strong> $3 million</strong>. The man is a successful rising actor, so the ratio of net worth will surely go higher. Michael owns an Audi A3, which costs <strong>$42,500</strong>.</p><p>In addition to this, the family is also up to charities and generally donates.</p><h2>Wiki-Bio- What Nationality Is Khatira Rafiqzada?</h2><p>Khatira Rafiqzada, the beautiful actress, was born on January 8, 1981. The lady was born somewhere in the city of the United States of America. She is an American by nationality while belonging to Afghanistan ethnicity.</p><p>However, not much information about her childhood, education, or siblings is out in the spotlight. It may be due to Khatira’s secretive nature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/khatira-rafiqzada-michael-ealy-102.png><p>It is due to the fact that the actress loves to keep her information private. Yes, Khatira is cryptic about her personal life and tends to keep every single detail about her background in the dark.</p><h2>Early Career- Who Is Khatira Rafiqzada?</h2><p>Khatira made her on-screen debut in 2009 with the movie Chain Letter. However, the movie did not get the hype that she has hoped it would. Conversely, before starring in films, the lady did some odd jobs in the restaurants in both New York and California.</p><p>The movie list went on and played a role in Layla opposite <strong>Jasmine</strong> <strong>Bissette</strong>, <strong>Marie</strong> <strong>Therese</strong> <strong>Abou</strong>, and <strong>Jawad</strong> <strong>Asephi</strong>.</p><p>The talented lady went to other streams and songs and music but didn’t get much appreciation in that field. The fame was getting low, but her relationship with Michael highly fueled it.</p><p>But after her marriage to Michael, Khatira has made herself absent from the entertainment scene. Not to mention, it has affected the net worth of Khatira Rafiqzada as well.</p><h2>Khatira Rafiqzada: Relationship And Marriage</h2><p>More than her career, the relationship of Khatira is one of the talked points in Hollywood because she is happily married to Michael Ealy, one of the aspiring stars in Hollywood. Talking about her relationship, Khatira met Michael early in 2008 and dated him for four whole years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/khatira-rafiqzada-michael-ealy-103.jpg><p>Later in October of 2012, the couple married and are living a happy life.&nbsp; The marriage ceremony was a pretty private event, and only the close friends and the family members were invited.</p><p>More than that, there is nothing much revealed regarding their marriage and relationship either.</p><p>The couple is blessed with a son on April 18, 2014, named <strong>Elijah</strong> and a daughter <strong>Brown</strong> in November 2016, but the name of the daughter is not yet revealed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Josh Gates wife Hallie Gnatovich Age, Net Worth, Bio >></strong></a></p><p>When the actor was asked about the daughter then the answer was pretty well crafted as he answered;</p><h3>“I just discovered a whole new love. I’ve never ever felt this way before. I was wondering if I could love another child as much as I love my son. And what I realized, within hours of my daughter being born, not only do I love her just as much if not more. It’s a special kind of protective love.”</h3><p>The couples are happy with their marriage, and there are no rumors of extramarital affairs as well. As a matter of fact, they resided happily and shared a good relationship.</p><h2>Khatira Rafiqzada- Age, Height, and Body Measurement</h2><p>The actress was born in 1981, which makes her 39 as of 2020. Not to mention, the American actress celebrates her birthday every year on the eighth of January. Also, her birth sign is Capricorn.</p><p class="single-entry-title entry-title"><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Nuttall Bio, Family, Career, Net Worth, Age, Height >></a></strong></p><p>Despite being in her late 30s, Khatira has got a youthful aura about her. Other than her looks, she has got a gorgeous figure as well. The body measurement is at the height of 5’8“.&nbsp; The singer has brown eyes and hair color and holds the American nationality.</p><p>In contradiction, the woman beholds the Afghanistan ethnicity as well. The weight is measured at 57 kgs, but other measurements are not disclosed.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>One of the more significant breaks from the movie chain letter and also being the wife of Michael Ealy is something surely of fame.&nbsp; But the surprising matter of fact being the wife of such an aspiring actor, the better half has made her life in a cabin hole and private.</p><p>There are no official accounts of Khatira, either be it on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57yqGYraGilnqzrcWiqLOZlJZ6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqKzxGaZoqddmK6zscSrZKaZoqe2orPEaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./lucy-liu-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Lucy Liu Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
